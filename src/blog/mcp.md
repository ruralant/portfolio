# MCP: Modern Content Publishing

## Introduction

Modern Content Publishing (MCP) is a set of best practices and tools designed to streamline the process of creating, managing, and delivering digital content. MCP focuses on efficiency, scalability, and accessibility, ensuring that content reaches users quickly and reliably.
Standard for being able to surface tools to AI. WWorks with IDEs like VSCode, CCursor or the OpenAI Typescript library.

Like early days of APIs, MCP provides a structured way to interact with content management systems, enabling developers and content creators to build robust applications that can adapt to changing needs.

## Why MCP Matters

With the increasing demand for dynamic and interactive web experiences, traditional publishing workflows often fall short. MCP addresses these challenges by:

- Automating repetitive tasks
- Integrating with modern frameworks
- Supporting responsive and adaptive content delivery

## Key Features

- **Automation**: Reduce manual effort with build tools and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Scalability**: Easily handle large volumes of content.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure content is usable by everyone.
- **Performance**: Optimize delivery for speed and reliability.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Choose a Content Management System (CMS)**

- Select a headless CMS for flexibility.

2. **Set Up Version Control**

- Use Git for tracking changes and collaboration.

3. **Automate Deployment**

- Integrate with platforms like Netlify or Vercel.

4. **Optimize Content**

- Compress images, minify assets, and use lazy loading.

5. **Monitor and Iterate**

- Use analytics to track performance and improve.

## Best Practices

- Write semantic HTML for better SEO and accessibility.
- Use Markdown for easy content authoring.
- Regularly update dependencies and tools.
- Test content on multiple devices and browsers.

## Authentication

At the time of writing, the MCP protocol is being updated and it's not able to use OAuth to authenticate. Also has transport protocol.

- can use standard io: the MCP server is going to be running on the local machine or in the same machine the AI process is running.
- can use HTTP MCP servers. You can send a POST request and it returns a JSON file with all the tools available. Durable objets or fluid compute.

## Sare reusable prompts

Cloufdflare can return a workers-prompr-full which is a massive file with a large list of possible promprs that the AI can use.
