      “A quiet secluded life in the countryside, with the possibility of being useful to people to
      whom it is easy to do good, and who are not accustomed to have it done to them; then work
      which one hopes may be of some use; then rest, nature, books, music, love for one's neighbor —
      such is my idea of happiness.”
